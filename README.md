# RedisTimeSeries Device Simulator

This project simulates the behavior of embedded devices using [RedisTimeSeries](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/timeseries/) to store and aggregate time series data.

The goal is to evaluate memory usage and compaction strategies (e.g. hourly average, daily max) over a realistic use case involving thousands of devices and millions of datapoints collected over 3 years.

---

## 💡 Use Case

Simulate:
- **1000 devices**
- 5 metrics per device: `temp`, `volt`, `current`, `gaz`, `alarme`
- Measurements every **10 minutes**
- Historical retention: **3 years**
- Configurable compaction rules 

### 📊 Volume Simulated

This simulation inserts:

- **1000 devices**
- **5 metrics per device**
- **1 data point every 10 minutes** → 144 points/day
- **3 years of history**

Which results in:

- `24*(60/10) × 365 × 3 = 157,680` points of measure over 3 years
- `157,680 × 5 metrics × 1000 devices = 788,400,000` TS.ADD operations

You can adjust this volume using command-line arguments.

Compare:
- Raw time series vs. aggregated compaction
- Memory footprint with or without retention policy

### 📉 Compaction Strategy

When enabled, raw time series data is retained for **90 days** (default value, can be overriden with `--raw_retention_days XX` days ).

This short-term retention keeps full-resolution datapoints (10-minute intervals) only for the most recent period. 
For longer-term analysis, RedisTimeSeries applies *compaction rules* which store:

- **1h average**: aggregated hourly mean values
- **1d max**: daily maximums

These aggregated series preserve historical trends while drastically reducing memory usage compared to full-resolution storage over 3 years.

This enables fast queries and visualization while controlling resource usage on memory-constrained systems.
